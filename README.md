Multi Dimensional Tic-tac-toe
=============================

Tic-tac-toe with multi-dimensions : Range { 3, 4, 5..., 99, 100 }

Initially I planned it to do with raw javascript. But I've plenty of samples on GitHub to showcase my knowledge on JS, e.g. :
1. Cross browser implementation of (Jon Conway's Game of Life)[https://github.com/deveedutta/gameoflife]
2. 

So, this time I'll create it using jQuery
